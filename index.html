                <p>
                    When I was young we weren't even allowed to speak our own languages in school.
                     They called it 'vernacular,' as if only English was the real tongue.</p>
                <p>Art itself is knowledge of the spiritual world.
                    Art is information from higher forces, 
                    by those who are talented. I'm not jiving
